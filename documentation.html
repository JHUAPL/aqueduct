<h2>Aqueduct</h2>
            <p>Aqueduct is a collection of software packages to facilitate the rapid development of applications using semantic web technology. Aqueduct provides a set of "building blocks" for creating applications where users can visualize, create, search, and mine semantic data, using open standards such as RDF.</p>

<p>Aqueduct is currently composed of several software packages:</p>

<p>Aqueduct extension for Mediawiki: The Aqueduct extension for Mediawiki that provides several services that allow external semantic data sources (such as Blackbook) to be integrated with a wiki. The Aqueduct plugin is distinct from Semantic Mediawiki (another third-party Mediawiki extension.)</p>

<p>Aqueduct API for Mediawiki: The Aqueduct API allows external programs to read and write semantic data from multiple sources in a machine-readable format by using the wiki as a "hub" or "router" for the data. This allows for the construction of a software system that leverages a wiki in conjunction with other tools or agents, without ending up with multiple inconsistent views of the data.</p>

<p>Aqueduct (Cistern) widgets for Mediawiki: The Cistern widgets allow for semantic data to be visualized from within wiki pages. Wiki pages with Cistern widgets serve a dual purpose &#45;&#45; they act as traditional wiki pages while simultaneously displaying "widget" controls that allow the user to browse semantic data that is related to the page that they are on.</p>

<p>Siphon: The Siphon allows for data authored in Semantic Mediawiki to be mirrored in Blackbook. This facilitates the creation of systems that combine the semantic authorship capabilities of Semantic Mediawiki with the data integration and analysis capabilities of Blackbook.</p>
